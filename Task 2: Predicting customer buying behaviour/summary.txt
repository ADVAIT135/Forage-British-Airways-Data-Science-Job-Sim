Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips.
This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be.
Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost!
Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This is possible with the use of data and predictive models.
The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data you use to train the machine learning algorithms.
For this task, you must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that you can build a high-quality predictive model.

With your predictive model, it is important to interpret the results in order to understand how “predictive” the data really was and 
whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). 
Therefore, you should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.
