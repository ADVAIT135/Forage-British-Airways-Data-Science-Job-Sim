2,Not Verified,"Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning.",0.5927,Positive
4,Not Verified,"We traveled to Lisbon for our dream vacation, a cruise to Portugal and Spain. Our friends did not EVER get their luggage. It was a two week cruise. Two weeks without a change of clothes or her CPAP machine. Contacting customer service was a nightmare. We never talked to a real person. Very little effort was put into getting them their bags. In one port we were on the ship and the bags were at the airport. The airlines did not deliver the bags nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go get them. The airline couldn’t be bothered to take the bags from the airport to the ship. BA says it is their policy to get you your bags within 72 hours. That is a joke! It’s been over two weeks and they still don’t have them. They are back home in the US and last they heard the bags were in Lisbon! If your have a choice, do not fly British Airways. Customer Service is non existent!",0.8392,Positive
8,Not Verified,"Angry, disappointed, and unsatisfied. My route was from London to Atlanta. My suitcase was not boarded, therefore not landed with me. For both comfort and safety reason, a bag always fly with its passenger and that did not happen. Claims and few phone calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably. Certainly, I was left with nothing but my backpack which contained not more than few snacks. Neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology. Meanwhile, I was also told that my bag would have been delivered through the next 24 hours which also did not happen. British Airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization, when it comes to customer service, is poor and uncertain. Still waiting for my bag.",-0.4118,Negative
10,Not Verified,"A totally unremarkable flight, on time, as comfortable as European configuration goes. No catering due to the storm - effect greatly exaggerated. This was advised by email, and a euro 15 was provided - not easy to use - but lounge made up for this loss.",-0.6042,Negative
14,Not Verified,"I flew London to Cairo and return in October 2023. It was basically a perfectly good pair of flights in Economy, with pleasant and professional cabin crew (especially on the return journey). Being only 1.73 m tall I have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane, the seat was OK if getting a little numbing after 5 hours, and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome. However, it must be said that the value for money was poor: with a checked bag on the return leg only, this was a nearly £700 ticket. And although I am content to pass the time by reading or sleeping, it was surprising to find no in-flight entertainment on 5-hour flights. However, overall I would still recommend BA and would do so even more enthusiastically if it was more sensibly priced.",0.969,Positive
15,Not Verified,"Absolutely the worst experience ever.  Flew into Heathrow, no problem. Waited for 5 hours, three extra hours, for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight. Scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day. They routed us through Madrid the next morning. That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection (their fault), they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport, they booked us a new return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then, for no reason they cancelled our return flight again! After hours, and hours and hours with customer service, we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight. Meanwhile, they lost my wife's luggage. We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it. Return flight? More problems with our reservations. At no point was British Airways helpful. They left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn. They completely ruined a three week vacation and they don't care. They wouldn't even let us speak to a supervisor or manager. Awful, bordering on passenger abuse.",-0.9903,Negative
16,Not Verified,"Flew back from Malta after scattering our son's ashes at his favourite spots. When we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset. A member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her. Her name is Tracey, an exceptional crew member. I noticed she spoke to other travellers in a courteous manner and was friendly. Each time she passed my wife she asked how she was and would she like anything. This kindness made a difficult time easier for us both. Aircraft seats were comfortable and service good for a 2hrs. 45mins. flight. Thank you B.A.",0.9628,Positive
17,Not Verified,"Cabin luggage had to go to cargo, even when I said I carried medicines. There was no time to get them out the hand luggage. The economy seats with Virgin Atlantic, KLM and even Ryanair have more space. Luckily it was a short flight.",0.6786,Positive
20,Not Verified,"I have flow on BA several times since the airline started non-stop service between Austin, TX and London Heathrow. Every year the service gets worse. I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section. 25½ inches. BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft. Thankfully I'm not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable. When BA first started flying out of Austin, the food was great. Now, when I arrive at Heathrow, I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I don't know where or who makes BA's food, but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London, I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic, but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits.",0.8708,Positive
26,Not Verified,"Flew with BA to Punta Cana. Took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights. On boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving. Apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason. The crew said there was nothing they could do (although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats). We were told to claim a refund on return home. We did this via a complaint form Ns BA offered us £100 in vouchers. We didn't accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back. We eventually got it but not without a fight. Very second rate shoddy airline.",-0.6127,Negative
34,Not Verified,"Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back.",0.7855,Positive
35,Not Verified,"Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA. What a disappointment. The Airbus A380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful. Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best. Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early. In future we will travel with one of the American carriers.",0.8441,Positive
37,Not Verified,"Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes. Not looking forward to the flight home.",-0.7866,Negative
47,Not Verified,"Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone. I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information",-0.9348,Negative
48,Not Verified,"My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight. Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day. Next day, the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas. Me and several other passengers spent the night in London. British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel (closest to our hotel) and told us that we can walk there if we want to. As a result, I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas. I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations, but over 5 weeks now, not a single feedback from British Airways. I will avoid all flights with them in future, and will share this story.",-0.8481,Negative
49,Not Verified,We will never fly British Airways again. Our flight on July 15 2023 from LHR to LAX was cancelled 20 hours before departure without any explanation. Since 8 weeks we are now waiting for the refund and BA does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellation. Very disappointing.,-0.6366,Negative
51,Not Verified,"British Airways has confirmed itself as the worst airline in the UK. Last minute cancellation, no explanation, refusal to book with another airline “because we don’t have an arrangement with them”. What’s happened to what used to be our national airline?",-0.743,Negative
55,Not Verified,"Flight cancelled, no crew! 9th September 2023, not peak holiday period so why such bad management by BA? Sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and then flight cancelled. As were other on that day. Why does BA continue to provide such poor service - a national disgrace.",-0.9502,Negative

70,Not Verified,"BA cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next 4 days. I had to spend £5k in expenses to get us back with another airline. 2 months later I am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my 3 written complaints. Even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this, so even they cannot escalate or inquire. Utterly useless.",-0.8268,Negative
78,Not Verified,"Flight delayed by an hour, it happens, no biggie. Had us change our gate at the airport, never happened before but I guess it's ok. Gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that, he did it anyway. Second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for 6'3"" travel bud.",0.5719,Positive
79,Not Verified,The staff are very rude and not trained properly. No exceptions are made for children and elderly people. The price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor,-0.725,Negative
81,Not Verified,Failed at all basic travel fundamentals: 1) Our flight was delayed. 2) Staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance. The fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored. 3) Staff were quite unpleasant.,-0.9019,Negative
93,Not Verified,"I booked Premium Economy from INV to LAX (via LHR). They notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for! Then they cancelled a flight on my journey to LAX! They then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on - the flight that I have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into LHR. They re-routed me from LAX to JFK to LHR - which I would have accepted - but they booked the journey in Economy (LAX to JFK) which my husband (6'4"" with a knee injury) - cannot do and now they won't change it - even though they have a direct flight from LAX to LHR with Premium Economy and unacceptable flight allows us 54 mins to transfer flights at JFK - and my husband won't be able to walk slowly, let alone quickly, after enduring the 6-hour flight from LAX to LHR. I have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and I also have online chat which proves I did not accept this re-routed flight to JFK but they won't budge.",-0.8981,Negative
96,Not Verified,"Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?",0.9841,Positive
98,Not Verified,"I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc.",0.7878,Positive
101,Not Verified,"Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended.",-0.6936,Negative
102,Not Verified,Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.,-0.7063,Negative
106,Not Verified,BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is short-changing passengers.,0.4404,Positive
110,Not Verified,"Airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly. Luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time.",-0.4903,Negative
114,Not Verified,"Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.",-0.876,Negative
120,Not Verified,"You can buy sandwiches and crisps but don't expect a hot meal. Because the plane is a narrow body , there are no screens. Not helping matters is the fact that the BA prebooking shop for food didn't recognise the flight number, and the onboard  WiFi didn't work.",-0.5849,Negative
125,Not Verified,This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.,0.882,Positive
126,Not Verified,"Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!",-0.5519,Negative
128,Not Verified,"I flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support. I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got.

136,Not Verified,"May 3, flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to Edinburgh. BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises. I will never use this airlines again. Beware of British Airways. They also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members.",-0.25,Negative
145,Not Verified,"My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

148,Not Verified,"Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.",-0.9296,Negative
149,Not Verified,Easy check in on the way to Heathrow. The flight was on time with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight. I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow.

152,Not Verified,"Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money",0.9763,Positive
157,Not Verified,"Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more.",0.8898,Positive
164,Not Verified,"Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",-0.4541,Negative

There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations.

Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey...

They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only).

Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse.

Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button.

On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned.

Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate.",-0.3561,Negative

Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands.

I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim"").

The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone).

However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative.

A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail.

They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again.",-0.9358,Negative
421,Not Verified,"Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",0.9327,Positive
422,Not Verified,"Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past.

After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again.",-0.296,Negative
424,Not Verified,"Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready.

I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight.

456,Not Verified,"Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently.

457,Not Verified,Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,-0.7362,Negative

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that!

This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked.

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service.

561,Not Verified,"Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",0.9792,Positive
575,Not Verified,"I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight. I am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that I valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways.",-0.8934,Negative
578,Not Verified,"I booked my honeymoon flight from San Diego to Barcelona in September 2020. I have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel, especially to other countries. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great. However, this is my honeymoon and I paid in advance for seats to ensure I sat next to my would be wife. This was more than $1,000 in additional cost. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I then asked if I wanted to make sure I sat next to my would be wife, they expected me to pay again? The answer was yes.

BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them.

The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us.",0.9397,Positive

After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around.

The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight.

So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that.

The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking.

778,Not Verified,"London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

785,Not Verified,"I have often flown British Airways and have considered them a good airline. However, their customer service has fallen to such a level that I must say it is terrible. If you have no problems this is a good airline. If you have any problems you will not be able to get any help. I recently flew to London from Chicago. They erroneously cancelled my seats although I had checked in over 5 hours before he flight. They then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage for 15 days. These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. If you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They do not. You can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages. Do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you.",0.3071,Positive
786,Not Verified,"Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.",0.9912,Positive
790,Not Verified,"Inflight crew were very helpful, polite and caring. Though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasant. The food and drink selection was pretty basic. However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful. I forgot to collect my suit which I had handed to crew member at the time of boarding. Upon approaching the BA counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain.

795,Not Verified,Gatwick to Orlando. Excellent customer service. On arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me. The return journey went without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.,0.3228,Positive

It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers.

809,Not Verified,"London to Faro. We booked our tickets (family of 7) two months before the flight with British Airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service (so we thought). Inbound flight seats has been booked and paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for the row 2 and 3. Outbound flight row 6 and 7. Two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to ""unlucky"" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. They've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well. Customer Service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never did. Will I ever over pay (£2000 difference) so I can have ""Good customer Service with British Airways ever again? - the answer is no .

After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. My daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. It was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. We got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. We headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. Boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 DEF. The seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. A321 so there was no IFE. We had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. Our route was a little different, instead of going over France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive. We didn't buy anything really, just food. While coming into Bulgaria, the views were nice. The landing was pretty good, despite the bump. Eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. The verdict is that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay.",0.962,Positive

We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures. After a second time of asking, I was told I could buy a drink once we took off, but they have no idea when that would be.

I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse.

Advice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park.

909,Not Verified,"Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. Rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!",-0.6981,Negative
916,Not Verified,Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.

The new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad). So on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bag. Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad.

980,Not Verified,"I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding.",0.9817,Positive
1015,Not Verified,"Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.",0.4135,Positive
1038,Not Verified,"Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area.

1077,Not Verified,"Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways.

When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price. Afterwards I phoned customer care to discuss the issue, customer care agent has dropped my call three times. On fourth time I was talking one of the customer care agent. He was not helpful at all, then I asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager, they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy.

1092,Not Verified,"London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first. Whether i would choose it over Club World would be on flight by flight basis. You have to do it once though!",0.9992,Positive

Plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite, efficient, welcoming and nothing was any bother for her.

1175,Not Verified,"Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There is no one to solve problems.

1385,Not Verified,Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter. British Airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service.,0.7972,Positive
1386,Not Verified,Flew British Airways from Bologna to London Heathrow. We arrived at Bologna Airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. We were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. For us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following day. We were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation. I thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines!,-0.2079,Negative
1387,Not Verified,"My husband and I booked our honeymoon to Italy through American Airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines, British Airways. We ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at London Heathrow and we would not arrive in Rome in the AM as planned. We decided to give it a shot regardless. We arrived at BWI and discovered we were not on an AA flight and had packed more bags than BA would allow. (We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). Luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. I can't say the same for the rest of our trip. We found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. The neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. We arrived into London around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. The BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. We again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in Rome. The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Once we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. Luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. Otherwise I imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. We are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from Rome to London.

1624,Unverified,"Rome to Heathrow. Having used BA Business / Club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday. It's been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from Rome was the decider. The cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats. No nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles, the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now. There was a choice of meals but you weren't told unless you asked. The meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away. Altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline. The advantages of booking club have gone, the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks, the priority labels mean you bags come off last, and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue.

I can't really review this flight as British Airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested I reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2 days. Ruined Xmas. I can review the total lack of customer service, the contempt for customers - all in all, BA are not just the worst airline, but the worst company I have dealt with. My rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of BA.",-0.6769,Negative
1653,Unverified,"London to Hong Kong. The Avios system is now a complete joke. They are impossible to spend. They release a minuscule number of flights and won't allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability - they've just quoted me nearly £2,000 to upgrade a flight this evening so I know there's availability - but they won't let me use Avios. Their concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrier. More modern airlines with easy to use air miles booking systems like Emirates deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline.",0.8798,Positive
1678,Unverified,"I have always given fair reviews to any airline. With BA and being a Gold (Emerald) member I have lost my patience. I have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade. Whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error, it has been 7 days of this. I have contacted BA through their twitter account to be told to call their Bahrain call centre, which of course does not work but have been told to call the Indian centre. 4 times I have called at my own expense to get people with poor English, have no idea how to manage the upgrade, quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price. Social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control. It has got to the point like so many other reviews I will use the avios and move to Qatar who appreciate their loyal customers.  My advice the ground as well at the air service is now budget.",0.2023,Positive
1743,Unverified,"London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",0.9179,Positive
1763,Unverified,"Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Innsbruck. Overall just about ok for value for money. Its a route where the price difference between economy and club is often no more than a £100 which is just as well because: Outbound, slow check-in, overcrowded lounge in desperate need of refurbishment (particularly the horrible toilets). No priority boarding, all bussed like sardines on the long journey to T3 where the plane was sat. On board, flight early, nice breakfast, good CC. Return, no lounge, no voucher to compensate for no lounge, no priority security, no priority boarding. CC again good on board and an ok lunch. Seats same in business as they are in economy.

1766,Unverified,"London to Barbados. Having used Avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance. The crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available.

In our opinion the airline are offering a ""budget experience"" at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them.",0.34,Positive
1779,Unverified,"Gatwick to Bridgetown. Firstly couldn't book myself in online - my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldn't move him, his seat was fixed. So we had to leave mega early so I could sit near him! Luckily got the seat behind him. Food and seats terrible. Tea time snack an insult, 2 small cookies. Breakfast was a muesli bar! I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. I have complained twice re check in, meals and the broken tray table on the return trip, and have been offered 5000 Avios points (£40) that just ties me into flying with them again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them!

1780,Unverified,"Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing.",0.4889,Positive
1790,Unverified,"Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return. Otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind.",0.9334,Positive
1791,Unverified,"London Heathrow - Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge. Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return. Docked at the ""B"" terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to T5/Terminal ""A"". All in all - another disappointing experience from the ""World's most frugal Airline"".",0.9681,Positive
1832,Unverified,"London Heathrow to Innsbruck. I have been a loyal customer of British Airways for 30 years. If ever I had a choice between them and another airline I chose British Airways, but no more. The new food and drink service is appalling. The crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows, so my children (sat at the back) went thirsty. This was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere - clearly that is not BA's fault, but it is their fault that I couldn't then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane. Next time I will fly Ryanair. I doubt we'll notice any difference.",-0.9269,Negative
1836,Unverified,"London Heathrow to New York. Paid £250 to pre-book my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat. Before we even left BA changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us. Luckily I spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat. To cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo! On complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund. I was told 'they are always doing this'. On returning back to the UK on Christmas Eve I contacted Customer Service and was told I would receive a refund (I took the Customer Services Operators name and ID number) - no refund. I completed the on-line complaints form - I received an acknowledgment - nothing happened. I wrote to the Chief Executive, no acknowledgement, nothing. I wrote to the Refunds Department, no acknowledgement, nothing. I chased Customer Services again and was told the Refund Department is so busy. I will never fly with BA again. To quote British Airway Customers Service response ""I completely understand why you’re unhappy you didn’t get your preferred seats. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. I hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon."" My response was that 'I don't think so'.",-0.8955,Negative

1843,Unverified,"Bordeaux to London Gatwick. As a former Executive Gold card holder (7 years running), my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status, back to ""blue"". I have just started flying again with British Airways and, just recently, the Bordeaux to Gatwick route, once served by a 737-400 and now replaced by the more modern A320. To my surprise the cabin looks very nice (although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of Ryanair) and has a pleasant feeling. Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional). If the food is ""M&S"" concept, why don't they get M&S to supply them the wines too? Years ago the selection process at British Airways was different and the wines were then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. My next BA trip is on February 18th, this time to Shanghai. I am concerned, though, to read the generally appalling comments about BA's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight, in economy!

Both legs on the A380 which is a super plane, spacious, comfortable and clean. Entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747's. Both flights were very good with attentive, friendly cabin crew and excellent food. My only complaint was that the inbound flight was 7 minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flight. BA should never book connections with such a tight schedule. Problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff, especially a BA manager at T5 who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helping to pay his wages.",0.9686,Positive

Mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficiently.

On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message also to that effect. Concorde Room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed, but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much. All in all good solid enjoyable flights. I would add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive.",0.985,Positive
